# uniform_hemisphere_points.py

A Python utility that visualizes the sampling pattern returned by `next_location_on_sphere`.  
It renders the positive (upper-z) hemisphere of a unit sphere and scatters **N** sample points organized in **slices** latitude bands.

## Features

- Renders a translucent upper hemisphere using **matplotlib-3D**.
- Draws latitude bands (“slices”) for visual reference.
- Converts the spherical coordinates from `next_location_on_sphere` to Cartesian and plots the points.
- Labels each point with its index for quick verification.

## Installation

Install with `poetry`:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage

```
usage: uniform_hemisphere_points.py [-h] slices N

Plot points generated by next_location_on_sphere on the positive hemisphere.

positional arguments:
  slices      Number of latitude bands (1 ≤ slices ≤ N)
  N           Total number of points to plot (N ≥ 1)

options:
  -h, --help  Show this help message and exit
```

## Examples

**Plot 8 points across 2 latitude bands**:

```bash
python uniform_hemisphere_points.py 2 8
```

**Single slice, 5 points** (demonstrates azimuthal distribution only):

```bash
python uniform_hemisphere_points.py 1 5
```

**Dense sampling**—4 slices and 24 points:

```bash
python uniform_hemisphere_points.py 4 24
```

Each command opens an interactive window showing:

1. A semi-transparent unit hemisphere (grey).
2. Blue latitude rings for the requested number of slices.
3. Red sample points, each annotated with its sequential index.

Close the window to exit the script.
